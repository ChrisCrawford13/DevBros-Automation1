# DevBros - Automation Coding Challenge

Create an automated test that performs the following actions, in **Chrome**, on the Wikipedia website:

Navigate to Wikipedia<br>
Search for the term "Automation testing"<br>
Verify that the search results page contains the correct page title "Test automation - Wikipedia" (The text you see in your Chrome tab)<br>
Verify that the search result contains the text "Test automation can automate some repetitive but necessary tasks in a formalized testing process"

You can achieve achieve this coding challenge with whichever coding language you'd like, as long as Selenium is used.

The technologies we personally use in our automation are:
Visual Studio, C#, OpenQA.Selenium, NUnit & chromedriver
